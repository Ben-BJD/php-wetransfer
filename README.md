# php-wetransfer

A super simple PHP script for downloading WeTransfer files (https://www.wetransfer.com/)

## Usage

You should have a we transfer address similar to either:  
https://www.wetransfer.com/downloads/XXXXXXXXXX/YYYYY or  
https://www.wetransfer.com/downloads/XXXXXXXXXX/YYYYY/ZZZZZ

Include the function code somewhere, and simply call it:

    downloadWeTransfer('https://www.wetransfer.com/downloads/XXXXXXXX/YYY');
